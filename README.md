This web app uses the Reddit .JSON API to retrieve reddit posts. This API doesn't require authentication or tokens. Data is obtained using a GET request with a URL that includes ".json". One limitation of this API is that search results use /search in the URL instead of /listing, and the results ignore the subreddit specified in the URL. 

## Technologies used

React javascript library, Redux library to manage all state, Jest and Enzyme testing libraries, CSS
